generate users (3 for presentation)

all new users will be guest

use auth/ascend to become an admin
use auth/promote to promote guest to employee
use auth/demote to demote employee to guest

step 2 
test authorizations via Users API

users/browse should be available for public
users/archive should be available for restricted
users/destroy should be available for elite
users/restore should be available for elite
